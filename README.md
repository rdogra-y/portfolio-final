# Rakshita Dogra - Portfolio Website (Assignment 14)

This is my **Component Library Portfolio Project (Assignment 14)** for the Full Stack Web Development program.

## Features

- React (Create React App)
- Material UI for components
- Dockerized production build running on **localhost:5575**
- Five main sections: BasicInfo, Work, Skills, Resources, Developer Setup
- Prettier + Husky pre-commit hook for clean commits
- Tests written using React Testing Library & Jest

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Create React App

```bash
npx create-react-app portfolio
cd portfolio
```

### 2. Install Component Library (Material UI)

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### 3. Set Up Component Folder Structure

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/BasicInfo src/components/Work src/components/Skills src/components/Resources src/components/DeveloperSetup
```

Create `.jsx` files in each folder like: `BasicInfo.jsx`, `Work.jsx`, etc.

### 4. Install Testing Tools (Already Included in CRA)

You already have Jest and React Testing Library via Create React App.

To test all files:

```bash
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

### 5. Set Up Prettier and Husky

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier husky
npx husky install
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
npm run prepare
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx prettier --write ."
```

Example `.prettierrc`:

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 100
}
```

Example `.prettierignore`:

```
node_modules
build
dist
```

### 6. Add Basic Tests

Example for `BasicInfo.test.js`:

```js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import BasicInfo from './BasicInfo';

test('renders Rakshita Dogra name', () => {
  render(<BasicInfo />);
  const nameElement = screen.getByText(/Rakshita Dogra/i);
  expect(nameElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Repeat for other components like `Work`, `Skills`, etc.
